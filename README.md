This project is a front-end user interface design for an E-Learning Platform, developed using HTML and CSS with a focus on clean layout, visual engagement, and responsiveness. The platform features multiple styled and interactive pages aimed at providing a user-friendly online learning experience. It includes essential components like a well-organized course listing section, where users can browse through available courses, each displayed with titles, descriptions, and structured design for easy navigation. Another key feature is progress tracking, which allows users to visually monitor their learning journey, motivating consistent engagement with course material. Additionally, the platform integrates video embedding, enabling learners to watch educational content directly within the platform without redirection. The UI is designed with clarity and simplicity in mind, using color-coded sections, responsive grid layouts, and intuitive navigation to ensure a seamless experience across different devices. From landing pages to course detail views and embedded video players, each section is carefully crafted to mimic a real-world e-learning environment. While the project focuses only on the front-end, it is built to be easily extendable with backend functionality in the future. This interface serves as a strong foundation for a fully functional e-learning system and reflects proficiency in modern web design practices. The project demonstrates my ability to design structured, multi-page websites with a consistent theme, suitable for educational or course-based platforms. It is ideal for learners, instructors, or developers looking for a visually rich and logically organized e-learning UI.
